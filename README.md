# AtmSystem
My first java project
<br>
This program:

• Demonstrates Encapsulation (private fields, accessed via methods).

• Provides PIN Security (all operations PIN-validated).

• Uses Multiple Objects (different customers/accounts).

• Handles both successful and failed deposit/withdrawal scenarios

✨Features:

• User chooses Deposit, Withdraw, Balance, Exit from a menu.

• PIN is entered before each transaction.

• Maintains 500 minimum balance.

• Shows both success & failure cases interactively.

• Multiple Accounts user selects  which account to use.

• Account Switching - after transactions, user can switch to another account.

• PIN Protection → every transaction is secure.

• Menu-driven → feels like a real ATM.
